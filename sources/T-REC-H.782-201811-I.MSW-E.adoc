[abstract]
== Summary
Recommendation ITU-T H.782 specifies the data elements and structures of the metadata for digital signage services. The metadata describes information for contents, terminal devices, play logs, playlist schedule, screen layout, etc. The metadata is handled by a digital signage server, a digital signage client, a content delivery server, and a content delivery client. It also specifies general information flows to describe how the metadata are used in the digital signage services.

This revision updates the data types of elements/attributes of identifiers. This update aims to widen applicability of the specifications at the price of easy extensible markup language (XML) validation.

== Overview

This Recommendation address metadata related to digital signage (DS) services to present details of contents and service information. <<h780>> specifies some elements of metadata that are applicable to digital signage services.

Digital signage server has capabilities for administration of digital signage system, control of content delivery, and management of digital signage terminal devices. Digital signage clients are responsible for content presentation, and interactions with audiences. The detailed functionalities of digital signage server and digital signage client are defined in [ITU-T H.781].

This Recommendation selects basic elements/attributes from these specifications that are applicable to digital signage services. Names of elements/attributes are quoted as they are in the specifications, in order to keep the relationship between the standards clear.

<<figure1>> illustrates a reference functional model for DS services as per [ITU‑TH.781], and the scope of this Recommendation.

[[figure1]]
.Digital signage service reference architecture
image::T-REC-H.782/image003.png[]

NOTE: <<figure1>> as per [ITU-T H.781].

Entities in <<figure1>> are as follows:

– *Audience/User*: the audience or user, or his/her own device;

– *DS terminal device*: the device that displays content received from a DS service operator;

– *DS service operator*: the business operator that provides DS services. It manages DS terminal devices for displaying content received from a content provider;

– *Content provider or business system*: this entity provides content to the DS service operator for a particular purpose, e.g., advertisements, information, alerts.

Main groups of functions within the DS terminal device and the DS service operator are as follows:

– *DS client*: is responsible for content presentation and interactions with audiences;

– *Content delivery client*: is responsible for acquiring content through a network;

– *DS server*: has capabilities for administration of DS system, control of content delivery and management of DS terminal devices;

– *Content delivery server*: delivers content to the content delivery client.

This Recommendation describes metadata handled by these four functional groups.

== Configuration of terminal device

=== Client configuration

The digital signage server configures the digital signage client with a set of metadata in the "client configuration" which includes allocation of _TerminalId_; see <<figure2>>. The digital signage server can reconfigure the digital signage client with the configuration information needed.

A set of elements/attributes for "client configuration" metadata is shown in <<table2>>.

== Play log

Digital signage server has log management functions to aggregate logs from DS terminal devices. The DS terminal device creates records for content played in the DS terminal device and sends the play log to the server. The details functionalities of digital signage server and digital signage client are defined in [ITU-T H.781].

NOTE: The digital signage server controlling and managing multiple clients can be overwhelmed with play log reports from a large number of clients. It is convenient to specify the timing of sending the report to avoid high server load intensity or network congestion [ITU-T H.781].

The digital signage client reports to the digital signage server of its play log with the set of metadata defined in <<table10>>, which describes a set of elements/attributes for "play log" metadata.

An example interactive service is as follows. The digital signage client has a touch screen that shows the map of a supermarket. The user touches the milk section to see the details of milk that are sold in the supermarket. The content displayed on the screen can be changed to display the details of milk products. For this use case, the function for scheduling a playlist will need to register an event to be notified from the touch screen.

| TerminalId‌Ref | Element of Event.A reference identifier to the terminal device (see <<table2>>). | M(1) | xs:NMTOKEN
| Interactive‌DeviceIdRef | Element of Event.A reference identifier to the interactive device (see <<table4>>). | M(1) | xs:NMTOKEN
| Event‌Data‌Type | Element of Event.Type of event data received from the interactive device.The suggested values are text, audio, video, position, but not limited. | O(0-1) | xs:‌NMTOKEN
| EventData | Element of Event.Event input data value from the interactive device. | O(0-\*) | xs:string
| EventAction | Element of Event.Indicates the action made by the digital signage client.The suggested values are start notification, stop notification, but not limited. | M(1) | xs:‌NMTOKEN
| EventDateTime | Element of Event.Time/date of the event occurred. | R(1) | xs:dateTime

|===

Supplemental explanations of elements are as follows:

* _TerminalIdRef_: denotes the reference to the digital signage terminal device that has the interactive device attached;

* _InteractiveDeviceIdRef:_ denotes the reference to the interactive device that is attached to the _TerminalIdRef_ in which an event has occurred;

* _EventDataType:_ denotes the data type of event that has occurred in the interactive device;

* _EventData:_ denotes the input data received from the interactive device. This metadata has used `xs:string` for the type of _EventData_, however, it can be in any format (such as text, coordinate position of the screen, audio stream, video stream, etc.) in accordance with the _EventDataType_;

* _EventAction:_ denotes the action performed by the digital signage client;

NOTE: For example, on failure to the interactive device, the event action is set to stop notification, since it is not possible to make correct notifications for such circumstances.

[appendix]
== Relation among metadata tables

(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation.)

This annex describes the relations among metadata entities that are used in this Recommendation. These entities are 'client configuration', 'terminal device', 'terminal device status', 'terminal group', 'interactive device', 'content delivery server', 'log server', 'playlist schedule server', 'content delivery schedule', 'play log', 'playlist schedule', 'contents', 'playlist', 'screen layout', 'region' and 'event'.

In <<figurea1>>, metadata entities including reference elements and the relations are described. The relations between two entities are derived from the "Support" attribute of reference elements in the metadata table, and the notation is as follows:

* stem:[M(1)] is relation stem:[1 to 1];
* stem:[M(1-\*)] is relation stem:[1 to 1..n];
* stem:[R(0-1)] is relation stem:[1 to 0..1];
* stem:[R(0-\*)] is relation stem:[1 to 0..n];
* stem:[O(0-1)] is relation stem:[1 to 0..1];
* stem:[O(0-\*)] is relation stem:[1 to 0..n].

If "type" attribute represents a list of references, the notation is as follows:

* stem:[M(1)] is relation stem:[1 to 1..n];

* stem:[O(0-1)] is relation stem:[1 to 0..n].

Arrow (stem:[A -> B]) shows a relation "A refers to B".
