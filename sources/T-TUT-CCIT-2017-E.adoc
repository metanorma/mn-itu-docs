== Abstract

The survey on Counterfeit ICT Devices in Africa was aimed at gathering information on challenges, use cases and efforts in place to address the problem of counterfeit ICT devices and collect information from Member States in the region to progress the on-going study on Counterfeit ICT devices, in ITU-T Study Group 11 and ITU- D Study Groups.

The survey explored the perspectives of Africa on counterfeit ICT devices. It also provides background information on the national initiatives to combat ICT counterfeit devices. The report of the survey is organized into five thematic blocks, as a result of responses obtained from the survey. These themes are:

* Common perceptions of counterfeit ICT devices
* Available Laws, Regulations and Enforcement
* Impact Assessment on counterfeit ICT devices
* Existing measures and techniques to combat counterfeit ICT devices
* ITU involvement and a possible creation of a regional group of ITU-T SG11

*_Conclusions from the findings showed among others that:_*

* Counterfeit ICT devices are commonly understood to mean "fake and substandard".
* ICT devices perceived to have been counterfeited are mobile phones, tablets and personal computers.
* Affordability and availability are the major reasons for the larger market and higher patronage of counterfeit ICT devices in the Africa Region.
* ITU's involvement in addressing the problem of counterfeit ICT devices through its standardisation work is essential.
* Conformity Assessment Schemes can be used one of the tools to combat counterfeit ICT devices.
* Member States recommend the establishment of an ITU-T SG11 Regional Group for Africa. They would support and participate in such group's activities.

It is therefore concluded from these findings that establishing ITU-T SG11 Regional Group for Africa to provide the regional views and influence ICT standards developments activities, particularly on counterfeit ICT devices, Conformance and Interoperability Testing and other related topics aimed at bridging the ICT digital divide is of essence. This report also recommends improved public sensitization and awareness creation on the negative impacts of counterfeit ICT devices as well as the development of regulatory frameworks to combat counterfeit ICT devices. The report should be used to progress the work currently on-going in ITU-T SG11 Question 8 and Question 11 as well as ITU-D SG 1 & SG 2.

== Background of the Study: Introduction

Globally, there is a common perception about the influx of counterfeit ICT devices in both developed and developing countries. The Africa Region is not an exception. The challenges posed by this menace to the present ICT age can be devastating – economically, socially, and environmentally. The lack of official study report in African region to trigger ITU's technical studies and possibly develop Recommendations that could influence decisions and policy directions, leading to solutions to combat counterfeit ICT devices was of interest in commissioning this survey.

During an ITU-T SG11 meeting held on 22 – 29 April, 2015, it was recognised that counterfeit ICT devices pose a lot of challenges in developing countries, particularly the Africa Region. Due to the absence or less available factual findings, SG11 endorsed a proposal to conduct a survey in Africa Region with the aim of gathering empirical information on the nature of the challenges, use cases and efforts in place to address such challenges posed by counterfeit ICT devices. This survey therefore, explored the perspectives of Member States from the Africa Region on the subject of counterfeit ICT devices. The survey was based on questionnaires sent to some selected twenty (20) African countries in the sub-region for which fourteen (14) Member States responded.

=== Overview of Counterfeit ICT Devices

The WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement, 1994) defines counterfeit trademark goods as "any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country of importation" (footnote 14 to Article 51). The term "counterfeit" is therefore used in the TRIPS Agreement only in the trademark area. It refers to infringing goods which are defined more precisely than ordinary trademark infringements on the basis that the trademark is identical to or essentially indistinguishable from the original. This text does not touch on the intention behind the use of the counterfeit trademark. It defines a counterfeit product in terms of the closeness of the mark used to a registered product and applies to cases where the goods are the same as for which the trademark is registered. In practice, such infringing goods would typically include cases where a mark is slavishly copied, deliberately to give the impression of identifying a genuine product <<wto>>.

=== Impacts of Counterfeit ICT Devices

Counterfeit products are not usually tested nor approved according to any regulatory requirements that may be applicable. The use of counterfeit products can be extremely dangerous. For example, there are reports of deaths due to the explosion of counterfeit batteries, cases of electrocution and fires caused by chargers, and documented instances of these devices containing high levels of hazardous substances such as lead and cadmium. Counterfeit equipment impact several sectors including manufacturers, operators, consumers and governments through loss of revenues, erosion of brand value, loss of goodwill, network disruptions, poor quality of service (QoS) delivery and risks to public health <<summary>>. Each of these sectors needs to respond quickly and uniquely to address the challenges in order to successfully reduce counterfeiting.

Manufacturers of original devices invest huge sums of money in producing quality devices, only for these devices to get to the market and compete with the counterfeit devices. Manufacturers of counterfeit ICT devices do not pay royalties to the owners of patents and copy rights, denying such owners of their expected returns that triggered the investment. Counterfeit mobile devices pose QoS delivery issues. Studies conducted in India and Brazil have shown that such mobile devices failed standard call attempts, high call drop rates and handover failure <<mmf>>. Because counterfeit ICT devices are cheaper, consumers prefer to buy them at the expense of the original devices that are relatively expensive. This directly impacts on the manufacturers' supply chain of genuine devices. In the mobile phone industry counterfeiters have taken advantage of the strong growth and have circumvented the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) thus shipping thousands of phones with duplicate IMEI through the unapproved national routes <<framework>>.

It is also reported that counterfeit equipment have high levels of hazardous substances like lead and cadmium. They are not subjected to extensive testing (i.e. health and safety, electromagnetic compatibility, low voltage) compared to genuine devices and are not normally type approved hence posing a very high safety risk to consumers. Those devices are normally sold without warranty and this denies the consumers the right to have their devices replaced in case they are faulty which is usually the case, thus counterfeit devices have shorter life span and therefore become expensive to the consumer in the long run.

Governments also lose huge sums of money from taxes because of the activities of counterfeiters in the sense that these products gain entry into the market through informal routes and therefore dealers of these devices do not pay duties and taxes. Government has to spend resources needed for other productive sectors to combat these illegal activities. Because counterfeit devices have shorter life span, they also create electronic waste and thus causing environmental and disposal problems to central governments and local authorities.

It is worth noting that whiles some countries, in the Europe, Asia and the US have implemented systems to combat counterfeit ICT devices to protect their markets, very less is known in the Africa Region. Ukraine in 2009 for instance implemented Automatic Information System for Mobile Terminal Registration (AISMTR) to protect her national market from imports of counterfeit mobile phones <<ukraine>>. There are other negative impacts of counterfeit ICT devices such as cyber-security related threats, facilitating drug trade, terrorism, jeopardizing consumer privacy, impairing safety of digital transactions etc. <<mmf>>.

=== Objectives of the Survey

The objectives of the survey were:

. To gather information on challenges, use cases and efforts in place to address the problem of counterfeit ICT in Africa.
. To consider a possible creation of a regional group of ITU-T SG11 in Africa to provide regional views on combating counterfeit ICT devices and C&I testing issues towards Bridging the ICT Standardization Gap between developed and developing countries.
. To enhance awareness on the impacts of counterfeit ICT devices in the region.
. To recommend best practices, including regulatory frameworks (in countries where there are none) as well as technical means to combat counterfeit ICT devices.
. To identify and recommend possible initiatives the ITU could take towards the fight against counterfeit ICT devices.

== Methodology

This section outlines the methodology used in obtaining the relevant data for analysis, conclusion and recommendations.

=== Design of the Study

The study employed both quantitative and qualitative techniques to enable the respondents express their views to aid the researcher with detailed data for analysis.

=== Population and Sample Size

The survey was conducted on African countries that are members of the ITU. Twenty (20) countries were randomly selected, out of which fourteen (14) Member States namely; Benin, Guinea, Uganda, Zambia, Sudan, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Gambia, Ethiopia, Burundi and Tunisia responded. Respondents were mainly Regulators and Ministries, in charge of ICT.

=== Data type and data collection

Primary data was collected for the study with the administration of questionnaires to the respondents. The distribution of the questionnaires was possible with the aid of ITU Head Quarters in Geneva through its Africa Regional Office in Addis Ababa whilst respondents' responses were received via the Internet. The respondents to the questionnaires were mostly Officers from ICT Regulatory Authorities and Ministries in charge of Telecommunications/ICT.

=== Data Analysis and Findings

SPSS and CSPro, both statistical data management software were used to collate, process and analyze the data received. The results of this analytical process have been presented using relevant statistical formats such as tables, charts and percentages. The qualitative responses obtained were used to throw more light on the statistical findings.

=== Conclusions and Recommendations

Conclusions have been formed out of the findings per the results of the data analysis. Based on these, recommendations have been made to this report.

== Data Analysis

This section presents the results of data obtained from the survey. The section is organized into five thematic blocks in perspectives of the study objectives. These include:

* Common perceptions of counterfeit ICT devices
* Available Laws, Regulations and Enforcement
* Impact Assessment on counterfeit ICT devices
* Existing measures and techniques to combat counterfeit ICT devices
* ITU involvement and possible creation of a Regional Group of ITU-T SG11

=== Common Perceptions of Counterfeit ICT Devices

==== The Perceived Understanding of a Counterfeit ICT Device

There are common perceptions over the definition and understanding of counterfeit ICT devices in the Africa Region. The survey explored such perceptions with respect to whether a counterfeit ICT device also means either of the following: substandard device, fake device, unregistered device or un-authorized device. Fifty percent (50%) of the respondents indicated their understanding of a "counterfeit ICT device" to mean a "fake device". The figure below presents the results.

==== Member States' Definition of Counterfeit ICT Device

When respondents were asked to indicate whether their countries have a specific definition for counterfeit ICT Device, only three countries representing 21% were in the affirmative. However, 79% of the remainder representing 11 countries had no definitions. The respondents who responded that there were definitions in their countries did not state what the definitions were however.

==== Known Counterfeit ICT Device among Member States

Responses to identify specific types of ICT devices known to have been counterfeited indicated that in general, mobile (2G, 3G & 4G enabled) phones and tablets were the most known counterfeited ICT devices in Africa. The chart below depicts the responses obtained. It could be observed from the chart that 2G, 3G/4G enabled mobile phones (also known as smart phones) as well as tablets were known to be the most counterfeited ICT device commonly found in the markets. The results of this analysis could be found on <<fig2>> below.

[[fig2]]

==== Patronage of Counterfeit ICT Device among Member States

Responses as to why patronages of counterfeit ICT devices are perceived to be on the upsurge revealed that there are "availability" of such devices in the market. Also "affordability" followed as the next influencing factor. Thus, people patronize the counterfeit ICT devices because they are available and affordable in the market. <<fig3>> below presents the summary of such analysis.

=== Policies, Laws and Regulations Including Conformity Assessment Laws

==== Policies, Laws & Regulations on Counterfeit ICT Devices

<<table2>> below presents the responses on countries that have national policies, laws and regulations for manufacturing, importation, distribution and usage of ICT devices, which are aimed at combating counterfeit ICT devices. The results indicate a 100% in the affirmative. In Kenya, handling of stolen mobile devices is a crime under "Section 322 of the Penal Code" while Substandard communication devices are prohibited under "Section 9 of the Standards Act, CAP 496".

==== Effectiveness of Laws and Regulatory Frameworks

On the assessment of the effectiveness of those existing laws based on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being highly effective and 1 being not effective, 50% of the respondents indicated that their national laws and regulations were effective, 21% of them indicated that their national laws and regulations were highly effective. It was however interesting to also know that 14% of the respondents acknowledged low effectiveness of their national laws with the same percentage being neutral. The analyses of these responses are contained in <<table3>> hereunder.

=== IMPACT ASSESSMENT

This section considered both the negative and positive impacts (if any) of counterfeit ICT devices. The data obtained is presented as per the analysis below.

==== Negative effects of counterfeit ICT devices

Responses on the negative effects of counterfeit ICT devices showed "infringement on property and copy rights or trademark" and "threat to the public health and safety" as the two effects that adversely impact the use of counterfeit ICT devices, recording 23% each. <<fig6>> depicts the analysis of responses obtained.

[[fig6]]
.Negative Effects of ICT Counterfeit Devices (Source: Survey Responses)
image::img07.png[]

==== Perceived positive effects of counterfeit ICT devices

Responses that were sought to identify whether there is/are any positive effect(s) on counterfeit ICT devices recorded as high as 57% for "affordability" and 29% for "increased universal access to ICT and internet". <<fig7>> is a depiction of the responses obtained. The Reason accounting for this were though, not sought for, it may include the uptake of social media by the youth in the region hence encouraging counterfeiters to invest in such affordable ICT devices.

=== Existing Measures and Techniques to Combat Counterfeit ICT Devices

This section considers existing measures and techniques that Member States have deployed aimed at combating counterfeit ICT devices in their countries. The researcher's questionnaires explored the feedback of this issue from the perspective of public awareness creation, technical measures such as testing and device authentication.

==== Awareness creation and Sensitization

On this, 71% representing 10 respondents said their countries have public awareness and sensitization programs on counterfeit whilst 29% representing 4 Member States indicated in the negative. <<table6>> presents respondents' views.

image::img10.png[]

On the issue of ICT anti-counterfeiting fora, which has the potential to support the awareness creation, educate the masses, and act as platforms to help implement policies and laws to check the proliferation of counterfeit ICT devices within the region, 43% of the respondents indicated that they had such fora in place in their countries. However, the remaining 57% without such fora is not encouraging requiring serious attention.

For countries where there are such fora, only two of such respondents could state such forum. For example, in Nigeria, there is no permanent forum but occasionally stakeholders are brought together for the purpose while in Kenya the forum is normally initiated by the Regulator with the involvement of the operators, suppliers and government agencies.

[[findings]]
== Findings

This section presents the findings from the data analysis in <<data_analysis>> above which was presented using relevant statistical tables, charts and percentages. The findings are outlined below.

. Though, there are no Member States specific definitions for counterfeit ICT devices, the terms "Fake" and "Sub-standard" are understood to mean "Counterfeit". From <<fig1>>, it can be seen that while 50% of the respondents understand counterfeit to mean "Fake", 21% also said counterfeit is the same as "Sub-standard". Findings in <<table1>> show that 79% representing 11 Member States had no specific definitions for counterfeit ICT devices. The 3 countries that responded in affirmative to have such definitions failed to state such definitions.
. Mobile phones are perceived to be the most counterfeited ICT devices in the region. This is true with all categories of mobile phone devices namely; _2G, 3G, 4G and tablets_. Personal computers also rank high in the perception on counterfeit ICT devices.
. Counterfeit mobile phones are easily patronized because of their affordability and availability in the markets.
. There are existing and effective laws, regulations and national anti-counterfeiting forums in place to combat ICT devices in the Africa markets. But it was interesting to note that 28% - (14% + 14%) - respondents were not convinced on the level effectiveness of their national laws to combat ICT counterfeit.
. Though Member States responded positively to existence of public awareness and sensitization programs on counterfeit ICT devices, it was interesting to know that all of the Member States also recommended for a highly intensive public education programmes to be in place.
. On ICT anti-counterfeiting forums, which have the potential to support the awareness creation and act as platforms to help implement policies and laws to check the proliferation of counterfeit ICT devices within the region, it is worth noting that 57% of respondents without such forums is not encouraging and requires serious attention.
. Member States have Laws and Regulatory Frameworks that establish the requirements for ICT devices to be legally imported and supplied in the market place. In addition, "Testing" and "Market Surveillance activities" dominate verification mechanisms for the authenticity of ICT devices. Both mechanisms recorded only 50% of total responses, indicating that much more have to be done in the region.
. "Testing and Certification" and "Type Approvals" are the dominant assessment schemes adopted to check market entry of ICT devices in the region.
. Majority of Member States in the region have no "ICT testing laboratory". This represents 79% (11 countries).
. Majority of Member States in the region confirmed that conformity assessment schemes can be used to combat counterfeit ICT devices". This represents 79% (11 countries).
. All of the Member States are in favor of creating an ITU-T SG11 Regional Group for Africa with over 79% indicating that they would support submitting a join contribution to the meeting of ITU-T SG11 (June/July 2016) for such a group to be established and would participate in the group activities.
. Majority of Member States are in favor of the need for ITU's involvement in addressing the problem of counterfeit ICT devices through its standardization work.
. The following four initiatives were recommended as relevant to be considered by ITU:

== Conclusions & Recommendations

=== Conclusions

Based on the findings presented in <<findings>>, the following conclusions have been arrived at.

. Counterfeit ICT devices are considered "fake and substandard" as per the understanding of the respondents in the Africa Region.
. ITU's involvement in addressing the problem of counterfeit ICT devices through its standardization work is essential.
. ICT Devices perceived to have been counterfeited are mobile phones and personal computers. The reasons causing this situation were not identified however. In the researcher's view, it is believed that the advent of social media and its acceptability by majority of the African youth could be among the key reasons for counterfeit mobile phones and personal computers. Also smart phones, tablets and personal computers are the most portable ICT devices used for modern data communications. As such there are high demands for them and counterfeiters have taken advantage of the demand.
. Counterfeit mobile phones are easily patronised because of their affordability and availability in the markets. It is the view of the researcher that in this modern day, people cannot move without access to communication services. Therefore, once people can easily get access to counterfeit phones, due to their affordability, they would acquire and use them irrespective of the negative effects on health, safety and the environment.
. The existence of policies, laws, regulations and national anti-counterfeiting fora show the preparedness of Member States to fight against the influx of counterfeit ICT devices.
. Much public awareness could be explored with the use of national ICT anti-counterfeiting fora.
. Member States have Laws and Regulatory Frameworks for "Testing" and "Market Surveillance activities" before and after ICT devices are imported and supplied. This is evident in the application of "Type Approvals" procedures and other assessment schemes.
. Majority of Member States in the region have no "ICT testing laboratory". This requires an investment in the areas of ICT testing laboratories.
. Conformity assessment schemes can be used to combat counterfeit ICT devices.
. Member States recommend the establishment of an ITU-T SG11 Regional Group for Africa and would support and participate in such group activities.

=== Recommendations

. Since most of the Member States in the Africa Region have no definitions for counterfeit ICT devices, it is recommended for the ITU to adopt the definition in the TRIPS agreement or develop its own standard definition for counterfeit ICT devices to help the industry and avoid the seaming confusion.
. Manufacturers of genuine products should take into account in their production, the financial constraint in developing countries particularly those in the Africa Region. They could produce authentic devices that are "affordable", ensuring their "availability" to aid combating ICT devices.
. There should be effective implementation of laws and regulations including effective awareness creation and sensitization to make counterfeit ICT equipment production, distribution and usage not attractive. Also national anti-counterfeiting forums to support the awareness creation and act as platforms to help implement policies and laws to check the proliferation of counterfeit ICT devices within the region should also be encouraged.
. Much more need to be done on Market Surveillance activities and Type Approvals in the region. For example, there should be constant validation of ICT devices at the ports of entry before they are allowed in the market place. The Ukrainian solution could be a very good approach to deter/check those devices that come through the unapproved routes. This will require a well-coordinated and committed effort among stakeholders like customs, police, regulators, standard and IPR authorities
. ICT equipment testing laboratory is required in this region to authenticate devices and give assurance to the general public. The ITU and other donor partners in this case should help by supporting Member States to establish same. This should be Government, or private sector led initiatives, at least for the benefit of the citizenry.
. There is the need for ITU-T SG11 regional group for Africa to be established to provide the regional views to influence ICT standards development, particularly on the subject of counterfeit ICT devices, Conformance, Interoperability testing and other related topics.
. There should be sub-regional or regionally harmonized ICT standards to facilitate regional trade. In this way, countries that have testing laboratories could have mutual recognition arrangements (MRA) at least, to enable those without labs benefit from the few established ones in the region. This could reduce the immediate huge cost of investing in building test labs while considering long term plans to expand existing facilities.
. The initiatives contained in the conclusion are recommended as relevant for ITU's consideration.
