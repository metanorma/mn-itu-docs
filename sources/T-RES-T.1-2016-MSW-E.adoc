[[section8]]
== Recommendation development and approval processes

[[itut_recommendation_approval_processes_and_selection_of_the_approval_process]]
=== ITU-T Recommendation approval processes and selection of the approval process

Procedures for approval of Recommendations which require formal consultation of Member States (traditional approval process, TAP) are specified in <<section9>> of this resolution. Procedures for approval of Recommendations which do not require formal consultation of Member States (alternative approval process, AAP) are specified in Recommendation ITU-T A.8. In accordance with the Convention, the status of Recommendations approved is the same for both methods of approval.

"Selection" refers to the act of choosing AAP or choosing TAP for the development and approval of new and revised Recommendations.

[[selection_at_a_study_group_meeting]]
==== Selection at a study group meeting

As a general approach, ITU-T Recommendations relating to numbering, addressing, tariff, charging and accounting questions are assumed to follow TAP. Likewise, ITU-T Recommendations relating to other questions are assumed to follow AAP. However, explicit action at the study group meeting can change the selection from AAP to TAP, and viceversa, if so decided by consensus of the Member States and Sector Members present at the meeting.

When determining whether a new or revised draft Recommendation has policy or regulatory implications, particularly related to tariff and accounting issues, study groups should refer to WTSA Resolution 40 (Rev.Hammamet, 2016).

If consensus is not achieved, the same process used at a WTSA, as described in <<voting>> above, shall be used to decide the selection.

[[selection_at_wtsa]]
==== Selection at WTSA

As a general approach, ITU-T Recommendations relating to numbering, addressing, tariff, charging and accounting questions are assumed to follow TAP. Likewise, ITU-T Recommendations relating to other questions are assumed to follow AAP. However, explicit action at WTSA can change the selection from AAP to TAP, and viceversa.

[[notification_of_the_selection]]
=== Notification of the selection

When the Director of TSB notifies the membership that a Question has been approved, the Director shall also include notification of the proposed selection for the resulting Recommendations. If there are any objections, which must be based on the provisions of No. 246D of the Convention, they shall be forwarded to the next study group meeting, in writing, where there can be a reconsideration of the selection (see <<reconsideration_of_the_selection>> below).

[[reconsideration_of_the_selection]]
=== Reconsideration of the selection

At any time, up to the decision to put a draft new or revised Recommendation into the "Last Call" comment process, the selection can be reconsidered based on the provisions of No. 246D of the Convention. Any request for reconsideration must be in writing (e.g.a contribution, or if submitted after the expiry of the deadline for a contribution, a written document that is then reflected in a TD) to a study group or working party meeting, accompanied by the reasons for reconsideration of the selection. A proposal from a Member State or Sector Member to change the selection has to be seconded before it can be addressed by the meeting.

Using the same procedures as described in <<selection_at_a_study_group_meeting>>, the study group will decide if the selection will remain as is, or if it will be changed.

The selection may not be changed once the Recommendation has been consented (Recommendation ITU-TA.8, clause 3.1), or determined (see <<director_announcing_intention_to_apply_the_approval_procedure>> below).

[[section9]]
== Approval of new and revised Recommendations using the traditional approval process

[[approval_general]]
=== General

[[procedures_for_approval]]
==== {blank}
Procedures for approval of new or revised Recommendations which require formal consultation of Member States (traditional approval process, TAP) are found in this section of WTSA Resolution 1. According to No. 246B of the Convention, draft new or revised ITU-T Recommendations are adopted by a study group in accordance with procedures established by WTSA, and Recommendations which do not require formal consultation of Member States for their approval are considered approved. Procedures for such approval of Recommendations (alternative approval process, AAP) are found in Recommendation ITU-TA.8. In accordance with the Convention, the status of Recommendations approved is the same for both methods of approval.

[[approval_speed_and_efficiency]]
==== {blank}
In the interests of speed and efficiency, approval should normally be sought as soon as the relevant texts are mature, by a formal consultation in which the Director of TSB asks Member States to delegate authority to the relevant study group to proceed with the approval process and subsequent agreement at a formal meeting of the study group.

The relevant study group may also seek approval at a WTSA.

[[status_of_recommendations_approved]]
==== {blank}
In accordance with No. 247A of the Convention, the status of Recommendations approved is the same whether approval is at a study group meeting or at a WTSA.

[[approval_process]]
=== Process

[[study_groups_applying_the_process]]
==== {blank}
Study groups should apply the process described below for seeking the approval of all draft new and revised Recommendations, when they have been developed to a mature state. See <<fig9-1>> for the sequence of events.

NOTE: A Study Group 3 regional group shall decide on its own to apply this procedure for the limited purpose of establishing regional tariffs. Any Recommendation adopted according to this procedure shall only apply to the Member States that are part of the regional group. The chairman of Study Group 3 shall be informed of the decision to apply this approval procedure and Study Group 3 at its next plenary meeting will examine the draft Recommendation in broad terms. If there is no objection as regards principles and methodology, the procedure shall be initiated. Only the Member States of the Study Group 3 regional group will be consulted by the Director for the approval of the draft Recommendation concerned.

[[approval_deferred_for_consideration]]
==== {blank}
Cases where approval of new or revised Recommendations should be deferred for consideration at a WTSA are:

. Recommendations of an administrative nature concerning ITU-T as a whole;

. where the study group concerned considers it desirable that WTSA itself should debate and resolve particularly difficult or delicate issues;

. where attempts to achieve agreement within the study groups have failed due to non-technical issues such as differing views on policy.

[[approval_prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

[[director_announcing_intention_to_apply_the_approval_procedure]]
==== {blank}
Upon request of the study group chairman, the Director shall explicitly announce the intention to apply the approval procedure set out in this resolution when convening the meeting of the study group. Such requests shall be based upon a determination at a study group or working party meeting or, exceptionally, at a WTSA, that work on a draft Recommendation is sufficiently mature for such action. At this stage the draft Recommendation is considered to be "determined". The Director shall include the summary of the Recommendation. Reference shall be provided to the report or other documents where the text of the draft new or revised Recommendation to be considered may be found. This information shall also be distributed to all Member States and Sector Members.

[[atudy_groups_establishing_editing_group]]
==== {blank}
Study groups are encouraged to establish an editing group in each study group to review the texts of new and revised Recommendations for suitability in each of the official languages.

[[tsb_text_availability]]
==== {blank}
The text of the draft new or revised Recommendation must be available to TSB in a final edited form in at least one of the official languages at the time that the Director makes the announcement of the intended application of the approval procedure set out in this resolution. Any associated electronic material included in the Recommendation (e.g. software, test vectors, etc.) must also be made available to TSB at the same time. A summary that reflects the final edited form of the draft Recommendation must also be provided to TSB in accordance with <<preparing_summary>> below. The invitation to the meeting, together with the summary of the draft new or revised Recommendation, announcing the intended application of this approval procedure, shall be sent by the Director to all Member States and Sector Members so as to be received at least three months before the meeting. The invitation and the enclosed summary shall be distributed according to normal procedures, which include the use of the appropriate official languages.

[[preparing_summary]]
==== {blank}
The summary shall be prepared in accordance with the author's guide for drafting ITU-T Recommendations. It is a brief outline of the purpose and content of the new or revised draft Recommendation and, where appropriate, the intent of the revisions. No Recommendation shall be considered as complete and ready for approval without this summary statement.

[[text_distribution_in_the_official_languages]]
==== {blank}
The text of the draft new or revised Recommendation must have been distributed in the official languages at least one month prior to the announced meeting.

[[seeking_approval_within_the_study_groups_mandate]]
==== {blank}
Approval may only be sought for a draft new or revised Recommendation within the study group's mandate as defined by the Questions allocated to it, in accordance with No. 192 of the Convention. Alternatively, or additionally, approval may be sought for amendment of an existing Recommendation within the study group's responsibility and mandate (see WTSA Resolution 2).

[[recommendation_draft_within_the_mandate_of_multiple_study_groups]]
==== {blank}
Where a draft new or revised Recommendation falls within the mandate of more than one study group, the chairman of the study group proposing the approval should consult and take into account the views of any other study group chairmen concerned before proceeding with the application of this approval procedure.

[[recommendations_elaboration]]
==== {blank}
ITU-T Recommendations are to be elaborated with a view to being applied as broadly and openly as possible, so as to ensure their widespread use. Recommendations are to be elaborated keeping in mind the requirements relating to intellectual property rights and in accordance with the Common Patent Policy for ITU-T/ITU-R/ISO/IEC available at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/]. For example:

[[drawing_attention_to_known_patents]]
===== {blank}
Any party participating in the work of ITU-T should, from the outset, draw the attention of the Director to any known patent or to any known pending patent application, either of their own or of other organizations. The "Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration" form from the ITU-T website is to be used.

[[holding_patents_or_penging_patent_application]]
===== {blank}
ITU-T non-member organizations that hold patent(s) or pending patent application(s), the use of which may be required in order to implement an ITU-T Recommendation, can submit a "Patent Statement and Licensing Declaration" to TSB using the form available at the ITU-T website.

[[approval_stability]]
==== {blank}
In the interests of stability, once a new or revised Recommendation has been approved, approval should not normally be sought within a reasonable period of time for any further amendment of the new text or the revised portion, respectively, unless the proposed amendment complements rather than changes the agreement reached in the previous approval process or a significant error or omission is discovered. As a guideline, in this context "a reasonable period of time" would be at least two years in most cases.

[[member_states_considering_affected_by_approved_recommendation]]
==== {blank}
Any Member States considering themselves to be adversely affected by a Recommendation approved in the course of a study period may refer their case to the Director, who shall submit it to the relevant study group for prompt attention.

The Director shall inform the next WTSA of all cases notified under <<member_states_considering_affected_by_approved_recommendation>> above.

[[approval_consultation]]
=== Consultation

[[consultation_of_the_member_states]]
==== {blank}
Consultation of the Member States encompasses the time period and procedures beginning with the announcement by the Director of the intention to apply the approval procedure (<<director_announcing_intention_to_apply_the_approval_procedure>>) up to seven working days before the beginning of the study group meeting. The Director shall request Member States' opinions within this period on whether they assign authority to the study group that the draft new or revised Recommendations should be considered for approval at the study group meeting. Only Member States are entitled to respond to this consultation.

[[tsb_receiving_a_copyright_statement]]
==== {blank}
If TSB has received a statement (or statements) indicating that the use of intellectual property, e.g. the existence of a patent, or a copyright claim, may be required in order to implement a draft Recommendation, the Director shall indicate this situation in the circular announcing the intention to invoke the Resolution1 approval process (see <<appendixII>> to this resolution).

[[director_informing_member_states_are_asked_to_respond_to_a_consultation]]
==== {blank}
The Director shall inform the Directors of the other two Bureaux, as well as recognized operating agencies, scientific and industrial organizations and international organizations participating in the work of the study group in question, that Member States are being asked to respond to a consultation on a proposed new or revised Recommendation. Only Member States are entitled to respond (see <<technical_and_editorial_changes>> below).

[[member_states_opinion_approval_shall_not_proceed]]
==== {blank}
Should any Member States be of the opinion that consideration for approval shall not proceed, they should advise their reasons for disapproving and indicate the possible changes that would facilitate further consideration and approval of the draft new or revised Recommendation.

[[member_states_supporting_consideration_for_approval]]
==== {blank}
If 70 per cent or more of the replies from Member States support consideration for approval at the study group meeting (or if there are no replies), the Director shall advise the chairman that consideration of the approval may proceed.

The study group should review the text of the draft new or revised Recommendation as referred to in <<director_announcing_intention_to_apply_the_approval_procedure>> and <<tsb_text_availability>> above. The meeting may then accept any editorial corrections or other amendments not affecting the substance of the Recommendation. The study group shall assess the summary statement referred to in <<preparing_summary>> in terms of its completeness and ability to concisely convey the intent of the draft new or revised Recommendation to a telecommunication expert who has not participated in the study group work.

[[technical_and_editorial_changes]]
==== {blank}
Technical and editorial changes may only be made during the meeting as a consequence of written contributions, of results from the consultation process (see <<approval_consultation>> above) or of liaison statements. Where proposals for such revisions are found to be justified but to have a major impact on the intent of the Recommendation or to depart from points of principle agreed at the previous study group or working party meeting, consideration of this approval procedure should be deferred to another meeting. However, in justified circumstances the approval procedure may still be applied if the chairman of the study group, in consultation with TSB, considers:

* that the proposed changes are reasonable (in the context of the advice issued under <<approval_consultation>> above) for those Member States not represented at the meeting, or not represented adequately under the changed circumstances; and

* that the proposed text is stable.

[[delegations_approving_the_recommendation]]
==== {blank}
After debate at the study group meeting, the decision of the delegations to approve the Recommendation under this approval procedure must be unopposed (but see <<delegation_not_electing_to_oppose_approval>>, regarding reservations, <<decision_during_the_meeting_based_on_final_text>> and <<delegation_abstaining_from_the_decision>>). See No. 239 of the Convention.

[[delegation_not_electing_to_oppose_approval]]
==== {blank}
In cases where a delegation does not elect to oppose approval of a text, but would like to register a degree of reservation on one or more aspects, this shall be noted in the report of the meeting. Such reservations shall be mentioned in a concise note appended to the text of the Recommendation concerned.

[[decision_during_the_meeting_based_on_final_text]]
==== {blank}
A decision must be reached during the meeting on the basis of a text available in its final form to all participants at the meeting. Exceptionally, but only during the meeting, a delegation may request more time to consider its position. Unless the Director is advised of formal opposition from the Member State to which the delegation belongs within a period of four weeks from the end of the meeting, the Director shall proceed in accordance with <<director_notifying_about_approval>>.

[[member_states_requesting_more_time_for_consideration]]
===== {blank}
A Member State which requested more time to consider its position and which then indicates disapproval within the four-week interval specified in <<decision_during_the_meeting_based_on_final_text>> above is requested to state its reasons and to indicate the possible changes that would facilitate further consideration and future approval of the draft new or revised Recommendation.

[[director_advised_of_formal_opposition]]
===== {blank}
If the Director is advised of formal opposition, the study group chairman, after consultation with the parties concerned, may proceed according to <<director_announcing_intention_to_apply_the_approval_procedure>> above, without further determination at a subsequent working party or study group meeting.

[[delegation_abstaining_from_the_decision]]
==== {blank}
A delegation may advise at the meeting that it is abstaining from the decision to apply the procedure. This delegation's presence shall then be ignored for the purposes of <<delegations_approving_the_recommendation>> above. Such an abstention may subsequently be revoked, but only during the course of the meeting.

[[approval_notification]]
=== Notification

[[director_notifying_about_approval]]
==== {blank}
Within four weeks of the closing date of the study group meeting or, exceptionally, four weeks after the period described in <<decision_during_the_meeting_based_on_final_text>>, the Director shall notify whether the text is approved or not, by circular. The Director shall arrange that this information is also included in the next available ITU Notification. Within this same time period, the Director shall also ensure that any Recommendation agreed to during the study group decision meeting is available online in at least one official language, with an indication that the Recommendation may not be in its final publication form.

[[tsb_making_editorial_amendments]]
==== {blank}
Should minor, purely editorial amendments or corrections of evident oversights or inconsistencies in the text as presented for approval be necessary, TSB may correct these with the approval of the chairman of the study group.

[[secretary_general_publishing_recommendations]]
==== {blank}
The Secretary-General shall publish the approved new or revised Recommendations in the official languages as soon as practicable, indicating, as necessary, a date of entry into effect. However, in accordance with Recommendation ITU-TA.11, minor amendments may be covered by corrigenda rather than a complete reissue. Also, where appropriate, texts may be grouped to suit market needs.

[[adding_text_to_the_cover_sheets]]
==== {blank}
Text shall be added to the cover sheets of all new and revised Recommendations urging users to consult the ITU-T patent database and the ITU-T software copyright database. Suggested wording is:

* "ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may involve the use of a claimed intellectual property right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or applicability of claimed intellectual property rights, whether asserted by ITU Member States and Sector Members or by others outside of the Recommendation development process."

* "As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had/had not received notice of intellectual property, protected by patents/software copyrights, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementers are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the appropriate ITU-T databases available via the ITU-T website."

[[publication_of_lists]]
==== {blank}
See also Recommendation ITU-T A.11 concerning the publication of lists of new and revised Recommendations.

[[correction_of_defects]]
=== Correction of defects

When a study group identifies the need for implementers to be made aware of defects (e.g.typographical errors, editorial errors, ambiguities, omissions or inconsistencies and technical errors) in a Recommendation, one mechanism that may be employed is an implementers' guide. This guide is an historical document recording all identified defects and their status of correction, from their identification to final resolution. Implementers' guides shall be agreed by the study group or agreed by one of its existing working parties with the concurrence of the study group chairman. Implementers' guides shall be made available by posting on the ITU-T website with open access.

[[deletion_of_recommendations]]
=== Deletion of Recommendations

Study groups may decide in each individual case which of the following alternatives is the most appropriate for the deletion of Recommendations.

[[deletion_of_recommendations_by_wtsa]]
==== Deletion of Recommendations by WTSA

Upon the decision of the study group, the chairman shall include in his or her report to WTSA the request to delete a Recommendation. WTSA should consider the request and act as appropriate.

[[deletion_of_recommendations_between_wtsas]]
==== Deletion of Recommendations between WTSAs

[[deleting_recommendation]]
===== {blank}
At a study group meeting it may be agreed to delete a Recommendation, either because it has been superseded by another Recommendation or because it has become obsolete. This agreement must be unopposed. Information about this agreement, including an explanatory summary about the reasons for the deletion, shall be provided by a circular. If no objection to the deletion is received within three months, the deletion will come into force. In the case of objection, the matter will be referred back to the study group.

[[deletion_notification_of_the_result]]
===== {blank}
Notification of the result shall be included in another circular, and TSAG shall be informed by a report from the Director. In addition, the Director shall publish a list of deleted Recommendations whenever appropriate, but at least once by the middle of a study period.
